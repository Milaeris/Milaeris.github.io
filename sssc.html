                        This game is currently in progress, as part as my senior year project along with 2 other
                        cs seniors. We are working with the Sitka Sound Science Center (SSSC) to create a game
                        to run on a touchscreen at their aquarium gift shop. Players control a salmon as it
                        avoids predators and works its way through streams and ocean waters.
